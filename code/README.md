Commandments
------------

-	Write your fucking code

	-	It's okay to use libraries to an extent, it's okay to utilize snippets from the internet, but please at least go through the code by either writing it yourself or reading it through multiple times.
	-	If you insist on using "AI" to help you code, keep it as a "non-driving" pair programmer with you. Don't just blindly trust what it says, but let it humor you with tidbits.

-	Strive to learn the fundamentals, not just the flavor of the month

	-	Become a Javascript developer, not a React developer
	-	Prefer standardized approaches instead of learning only the library-specific approach to a problem
	-	Use libraries but with moderation (see "Write your fucking code")

-	Readable code is always faster

	-	Even if an approach would benchmark better in an unreadable format, readable code will allow developers to implement new features faster
	-	The only exception is a multiple of 10 or 100x speed difference, but that shouldn't happen with just syntax sugaring

-	If you run into unreadable code, deprecated documentation or something that annoys you, fix it on the spot.

	-	No need to make a ticket out of it, or just let someone else do it.
	-	The so called "boyscout rule": Leave the code in a better shape when you leave, than it was when you entered it.
